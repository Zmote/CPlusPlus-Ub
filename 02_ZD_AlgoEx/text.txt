Please figure out, in which standard header file the following elements of namespace std are declared.
Also point out, if it is a variable, function or type. 
Please note, in a concrete compiler implementation the exact place might be in another header file than the official standard one. 
You should provide the latter. 
Consult provided online references, if in doubt and to check your answers.
