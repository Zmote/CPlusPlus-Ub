1. Why can't be use the front() and back() member functions from BoundedBuffer?
  -
2. Why doesn't it make sense to provide iterators for BoundedQueue?
  - Because of concurrent access, the underlying Buffer might be changed during
  Iterator-Iteration, which isn't allowed for the Iterator to work properly.
  Ie. the Iterator gets invalidated when the underlying Buffer is changed, thus
  there is not much sense to implement one.
3. Can you suggest an alternative means for observing the BoundedQueue content?
  - You could freeze the BoundedQueue during Iteration or any operation that
  tries to unveil the underlying contents. This could be very inefficient though
  and time consuming, because the BoundedQueue would be locked for multiple
  content operation(ie. Iteration over elements), which in the face of conurrency
  would lead to performance drops that might even undermine concurrency.
4. Why is pop() returning a value by value and not void as in BoundedBuffer?
  - Because as the name suggests, it's a queue, ie. the objects are needed
  afterwards for further operations. It is returned by value, because
  during the pop-operation the object is destroyed, therefore we can't return
  a reference as well.
